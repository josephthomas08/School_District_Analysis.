# School_District_Analysis.
In the above mentioned School district Analysis the tools used were  Python and Pandas library to analyze school district data and trends in school performance
## Key Objectives 
* To create the district and school summary DataFrames.
* To Calculate the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools.
* To calculate the average math and reading score for students in each grade level at each school.
* To calculate the school performance based on the spending per student.
* To calculate the school performance based on the size of the school.
* To calculate the school performance based on the type of school.

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

1. How is the district summary affected?

  1. The Average math and reading scores are approximately same. 
  2. The score becomes hardly shifts  from 79.0 to 78.9 for math and stays the same at 81.9 for reading. 
  3. The percetages has gone down for passing math from 75 to 74.8 which is very minimal change, passing reading from 86 to 85.7 which is again very minimal change, and overall  passing from 65 to 64.9.

In brief the affect in district summary is negligible.

Thomas high School was initially positioned at second place based on overall % but after the change it was not in the top 5. 

The observation in addition to shift in position to 13th from second, it was noted that:
  1. The average score was the same at 83.4 for math
  2. The score for reading is also very similar whith minor change from 83.8 to 83.9
  3. Percentages for all had  gone down from 93 to 67 for passing math, and 96 to 69 for passing reading, and 91 to 65 for overall passing.

Thomas High school was originally placed at second based on % overall passing, but not even in top 5 anymore after changing. The average score stays the same at 83.4 from math, and increases from 83.8 to 83.9 for reading; however, percetages all go down from 93 to 67 for passing math, and 6 to 4 for passing reading, and 91 to 65 for overall passing.


3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

The ranking of Thomas High school was observed to have nose dive from 2nd to 13th poistion among a total of 15 schools.


4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  1  Math and reading scores by grade

  The average math and reading score stays the same for all the school spendings observed above, but the  % goes down particularly for the school Spending range $623 ~ 642 from 73 to 67 for passing math, and from 63 to 56 for overall passing.
